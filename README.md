This library uses a fallback methodâ€”based on the [NLTK readability plugin][nltk] and the algorithm implemented in the [Lingua::EN::Syllable perl module][perl].

The original work on which this is based was done by Thomas Jakobsen, Thomas Skardal, and Greg Fast; their contribution to the open-source community is greatly appreciated.

## Requirements

Java 8 and Maven 3 are necessitated for using this library.

## Installation

Visit the [Maven Central page](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:eu.crydee%20a:simplified-syllable-counter) to find the installation guide for your build tool or to directly download the jar.

## Usage

The library usage is straightforward. Use the `count` method to get the number of syllables in a word:

```java
import eu.crydee.syllablecounter.SyllableCounter;

...

SyllableCounter sc = new SyllableCounter();
int myCount = sc.count("facility");
// myCount holds 4
```
